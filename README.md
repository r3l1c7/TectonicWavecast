# TectonicWavecast

**An open-source earthquake forecasting platform modeling tectonic stress migration, directional quake sequences, and real-time seismic risk zones.**

---

## Overview

TectonicWavecast is a scientific forecasting engine inspired by the observational work of Dutchsinse. It is built on a foundation of physics-based tectonic stress modeling, directional propagation logic, and optional machine learning.

It aims to:

- Detect directional chains of earthquakes across connected faults and plate boundaries  
- Model stress redistribution after quakes using simplified and Coulomb-based models  
- Forecast regions of elevated seismic risk—not exact events, but "next likely zones"  
- Operate in both historical analysis and real-time monitoring modes

## Our Philosophy

We believe scientific innovation begins with bold questions and transparent testing.

While mainstream seismology remains cautious on earthquake forecasting, TectonicWavecast is built on the idea that directional propagation, tectonic stress migration, and fault network interactions can be modeled—and may one day enable accurate, actionable seismic forecasts.

## Why This Matters

Current academic seismology does not forecast earthquakes with useful precision. TectonicWavecast explores a new paradigm:

- Earthquakes tend to migrate through fault systems in directional sequences  
- Deep-focus quakes may have long-distance influence on crustal activity  
- Seismic “domino effects” can be modeled using graph-based and stress-based techniques

## Tribute to Dutchsinse

This project draws inspiration from Michael Janitch (Dutchsinse), whose independent analysis of global seismic patterns challenged conventional thinking in earthquake science.

Though his methods have often been dismissed due to lack of formalism, Dutchsinse introduced compelling hypotheses:

- That earthquakes propagate directionally across tectonic plates  
- That deep seismic events can influence distant shallow quakes  
- That historical quake chains reveal patterns overlooked by conventional models  

We honor his **forward-thinking approach**, and aim to validate, refine, and formalize his core ideas using open data, reproducible science, and real-time technology.
